# fadingsholdables
A compilation of my current Holdablepad creations in one package.

To enter these files into your Holdablepad:
1. Download this package as a zip
 2. Find your gorilla tag directory
  3. Go another-axiom-gorilla-tag -> BepInEx -> plugins -> HoldablePad -> CustomHoldables
   4. Unzip the package
    5. Drag and drop the files into your CustomHoldables file
 
 Then you can enjoy the high quality Holdables tested and taylored for perfect(ish) fit. Anyway its 2 AM and I need some sleep. Enjoy :)
